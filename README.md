========

Cellular automata image generator. Generates PNG files based on input. 

Syntax: automata.py \[initial state\] \[(8-bit rule state string) OR (decimal rule number up to 256)\] \[number of iterations\].

e.g. python automata.py 10101 10101010 100

Intended to be used with graphs and the networkx library, eventually.
